# Host galaxy library for type Ia SN simulations
# Created based on the work of Wiseman et al. 2022
# In the file "Hostlib_Allz..." you will find columns for host galaxy properties as well as "SN age". The SN ages have been sampled from an SN age distribution for each host, itself created by convolving a t^-1.13 delay time distribution with a star-formation history
